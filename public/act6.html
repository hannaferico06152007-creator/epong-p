    <p>A pleasant day! I’m Precyl Mae Epong,currently 19 yrs old and i'll turn 20 this <a href="./act3.html">30th of May</a>,
        
I am a first‑year college student at Western Mindanao State
University(WMSU) ,majoring in Bachelor of Science in Computer Science(BSCS) . I’m
passionate about some certain subjects like math and science,I love digging into projects
that blend theory with real‑world application. When I’m not in class, you’ll catch me
doing my hobbies; practice coding,dancing or hanging out with friend at the
campus canteen.</p>

<p>I thrive on curiosity and collaboration, so I’m always up for group studies, hackathons, or
volunteering for community clean-up drive in our barangay. My recently work in my
boss's korean restaurant at Don Andres, Ipil, Zamboanga Sibugay. While working there
taught me how to work hard and at the same time focus on my studies, and I’m eager to
apply that knowledge to new challenges. I’m also a big fan of OPM's and believe a good
playlist can power any study session.</p>

<p>Looking ahead, I’m aiming to enhance my skills as a computer science student and land
an internship, publish a paper, lead a student organizations and eventually to stabilize my
career]. I’m always open to meeting people with similar vibes, so feel free to reach
out—let’s chat, collaborate, or just swap recommendations.</p><br>
